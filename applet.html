<p> <a href="castles/index.html">On this page</a> (suggest open in a
new tab) there is a sample of lenses, mostly from CASTLES, an survey
from about ten years ago. For each lens, there are links to images of
the lens (in different wavelength ranges). Coordinates of multiple
images must in principle be read off the raw images, but this sample,
that work has already been done and the coordinates are provided. </p>

<p> Our project is the following. First, teach ourselves how to go
from raw image to lens model.  Second, make it possible for volunteers
to do the same. </p>
